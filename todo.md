ill create a model for users, then how do i handle interviews? give me a suggestion; i have in mind that i create a model interviews with fields lke user(applicant) and HR(eg: the ai), duration, many to many field for timestamped questions and answers, another  for answers mapped to users and interview, another for questions for mapped to the ai and interview or instead of having questions and answers i could just have, since an interview is a dialogue, i could have one statement model with fields like speaker(either user or ai), repliesTo(another statement), answersQuestion(bool) etc

give me a suggestion with great implementation following best practices
