## Technical Approach

### Backend (FastAPI)

#### API Design:
- RESTful API endpoints for:
  - **Authentication** (`/auth`)
  - **Interview scenarios** (`/interviews`)
  - **Feedback and reports** (`/feedback`)
- Real-time communication (using WebSockets or a Pub/Sub model).

#### AI/NLP Integration:
- Integrate with OpenAI's GPT models for question generation and conversational AI.
- Optional: Leverage Hugging Face models for on-premise deployments.

#### Database:
- Use **PostgreSQL** for structured data (users, scenarios, results).
- **Redis** for caching frequently used interview templates.

#### Testing and Deployment:
- Unit and integration tests using **pytest**.
- Use **Docker** for containerized deployment.

### Frontend (Next.js)

#### UI/UX Features:
- Modern, intuitive design with a focus on interactivity.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly.

#### Key Components:
- **Interview Simulator:**
  - Live Q&A simulation with AI responses.
- **Progress Dashboard:**
  - Data visualization using libraries like **Chart.js** or **Recharts**.
- **Admin Panel:**
  - For HR professionals to create custom interview scenarios.

#### Integration with Backend:
- Use **Axios/Fetch** for API calls.
- **WebSockets** for real-time chat/interview simulation.

## Additional Ideas for Differentiation

### Gamification:
- Levels, leaderboards, and rewards to engage users.

### Voice Input/Analysis:
- Allow users to speak answers and get feedback on delivery and tone.

### Community Features:
- Peer-to-peer mock interviews.
- Public interview recordings for inspiration.

## Next Steps

### MVP Definition:
- Decide on the minimum features for launch (e.g., authentication, simple interview flow, basic feedback).

### Architecture Design:
- Create a flow diagram to map interactions between frontend, backend, and third-party services.

### Tech Stack Finalization:
- Identify libraries and tools for both AI and UI.
